Objective was to identify and benchmark several advanced convolutional neural network (CNN)architectures for distinguishing the full ASL alphabet, and then to embed the mostaccurate model into a live recognition stream driven by a webcam and MediaPipe hand tracking. 
This study trained and fine-tuned a suite of pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and MobileNetV2 alongside a custom CNN on a balanced ASL dataset of 27 handshape classes.
